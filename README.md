# Object-Detection-with-YOLO-and-Python-Training-Inference
This repository showcases object detection using YOLOv8 and Python. It covers model training on a custom COCO dataset, evaluating performance, and performing object detection on sample images. The trained model is exported in ONNX format for flexible deployment. Perfect for getting started with YOLO-based object detection tasks!
